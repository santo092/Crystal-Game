# unit-4-game

The project is a crystal game that has 4 crystals available to be clicked which the sum of all needs to target the number given. Instructions are given before scrolling down to play the game.

Every individual crystal points reset once the target is reached or after losing the game by going over the target number.

The project is useful to practice jQuery, Javascript, some CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

This wouldn't be possible without all the knowledge we all managed to learn in class in a span of only 2 & 1/2 weeks.
Thanks to Travis, and all the TA's for all the help.
